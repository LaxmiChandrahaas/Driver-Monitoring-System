# Driver Monitoring System (DMS)

A real‑time driver drowsiness detection system built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe Tasks API**.  
It monitors eye closure, blink patterns, yawning, and head posture using a standard webcam, and displays a live dashboard with fatigue indicators.

## Features

- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** based drowsiness detection  
- **Blink counting** (detects rapid eye closure)  
- **Yawn detection** via Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)  
- **Head‑down posture detection** (tilt estimation)  
- **Fatigue percentage** – computed from EAR moving average  
- **Live dashboard overlay** showing:
  - EAR value
  - Blink count
  - Yawn count
  - Fatigue level (%)
  - Status: `AWAKE`, `DROWSY`, or `HEAD DOWN`
  - Session timer
- **Audio alerts** (optional – easily extendable)  
- **Modular code** – ready for hardware/IoT integration
